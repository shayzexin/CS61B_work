# CS 61B Spring 2021 lab 

This repository contains my personal work and notes for the UC Berkeley course **CS 61B: Data Structures**, Spring 2021 edition.

---

## Purpose

-  Serve as a personal study record for the course.
-  Provide a reference for future students or self-learners.
-  Explore the design and implementation of data structures and version-control systems in Java.

## Notes on Project 2: 

- The `merge` command is **not implemented**, but the document in gitlet-design, I wrote down the merge logic.
- The project was **not submitted to the official autograder**, so correctness is not guaranteed, some bugs may remain in corner cases.

## Notes on Project 3: 

- This project was **not implemented**, after evaluating the tradeoff between effort and learning gain.
- Focus has shifted to progressing quickly into **CS 61C**.
